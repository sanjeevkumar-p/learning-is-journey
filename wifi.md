Pinky and John are classmates who often have doubts during lessons. But whenever they try asking their teacher a question, they end up talking at the same time. The teacher hears noise but can't understand either of them. This keeps happening, so they decide to come up with a plan.

The Plan:

1. Listen Before Talking (CA/CCA - Clear Channel Assessment):
Before asking a question, Pinky and John must check if the other person is already speaking. If someone is talking, they wait.

2. Waiting Based on Announced Time (NAV - Network Allocation Vector):
If John starts speaking and says, "This will take 10 seconds," Pinky must wait for those 10 seconds before even considering asking her question.

3. Waiting a Bit More (IFS - Interframe Space):
Once the 10 seconds are up, Pinky still doesn't jump in immediately. She waits for a brief pause to ensure no one else speaks.

4. Random Wait Before Asking (Backoff Timer):
Even after the pause, Pinky doesnâ€™t just blurt out her question. Instead, she picks a random wait time between 10 to 100 seconds and starts a countdown.
If someone else speaks during her countdown, she pauses and resumes only when it's quiet again. If her timer reaches zero and no one is talking, she finally raises her hand and asks her question.

5. Getting a Response (ACK - Acknowledgment):
If the teacher acknowledges her question (nods or responds), great!
If not (maybe the teacher didnâ€™t notice), she waits and tries again. But this time, the waiting range increases (now between 10 to 200 seconds).

The same logic applies when a WiFi station (STA) wants to send data:

1. Check If the Medium Is Free (CA/CCA - Carrier Sensing):
A station listens to see if another station is transmitting. If the channel is busy, it waits.

2. Respecting the Declared Wait Time (NAV - Network Allocation Vector):
If a station receives a frame that specifies how long the medium will be occupied (e.g., 500 microseconds), it sets a NAV timer and waits for that duration.

3. Waiting a Little More (IFS - Interframe Space):
After the NAV timer expires, the station still waits a small, predefined period before attempting to send data.

4. Randomized Wait to Avoid Collisions (Backoff Mechanism):
The station picks a random number of slots (within a range) and counts down.
If another station starts transmitting during this countdown, it pauses and resumes only when the medium is free again.
Once the countdown reaches zero and the medium is idle, the station finally transmits its data.

5. Receiving an Acknowledgment (ACK):
If the receiving device successfully gets the data, it sends back an ACK.
If no ACK is received (maybe due to interference or collision), the sender assumes failure and retries.
To prevent repeated collisions, the station doubles its waiting range (Contention Window, CW) and selects a new random backoff time. This process is called Binary Exponential Backoff.

Extending to this, 

Priya has a tolerance time limit varies between- CWmin and CWmax. While she was asking question, if someone interrupted, she will increase her waiting time (backoff time) to some extent where the wait time is greater than previous wait time. The max time she can wait is CWmax and beyond that she will drop from asking question and retry later ðŸ˜€

CWmin is initial wait time for sending data. If other station interrupted, Backoff time is extended 

generally, CW = min( 2 * CW, CWmax) whichever is minimum. If no collision occurs, CW resets to CWmin, else it will be with calculated CW value.

Higher CWmin â†’ More waiting time â†’ Less collision but increased latency.
Lower CWmin â†’ Faster transmission but higher chance of collision.
Higher CWmax â†’ Better for dense networks to reduce frequent retries.
Lower CWmax â†’ Suitable for low-traffic networks for quick transmissions.

These are configurable params for AP as part of QoS. Different type of traffic will have different CWmin and CWmax values. If we are observing delays in QoS based traffic, we can configure CWmin and CWmax values as per above (either higher or lower values) based on our traffic needs
